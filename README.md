## Project Overview 

The real estate market in the city of Buffalo is growing rapidly, with a plethora of properties available for purchase. However, potential buyers often find it challenging to navigate the vast amount of data available regarding property types, sizes, values, owners, locations, and room counts. To address this issue, our team proposes the development of a structured database that will provide a user-friendly frontend visual on the dataset as a whole. 

The database will contain over 90,000 rows of tax parcels in the city of Buffalo, along with information on vacant land available for sale and property tax details. Our project aims to create a database that displays information about properties available for sale in the city of Buffalo. With this database, users can easily search, filter, sort, and compare properties based on their needs and preferences, leading to more informed decisions and a more efficient real estate market in Buffalo. This project will benefit individuals, business people, home owners, investors, government contractors, and anyone interested in the Buffalo real estate market. 

In this report, we will discuss the project description and problem statement, as well as the methods and technologies used to create the database.
